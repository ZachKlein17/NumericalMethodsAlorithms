# False Position
## Description
This is the matlab script for a user defined function that estimates the root for a given function.
### Inputs
Inputs include the function to be evaluated, upper and lower bounds, and stopping criteria in the form of desired relative error and a maximum number of iterations.
### Outputs
Outputs include the root, the function evaluated at this value, the approximate relative error, and the number of iterations performed.
### Limitations
Limitations include the inability to detect double roots and allowing the user to bracket more than one root.
